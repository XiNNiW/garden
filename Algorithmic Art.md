# Algorithms art

Algorithmic art is any art using a strict process to generate some aspect of the work. Note that this may or may not involve the use of a computer. 

For example, dancing a may pole is a form of algorithmic dance. Weaving patterns can be thought of as algorithms and inspired early concepts of computers.
