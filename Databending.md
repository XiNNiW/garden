# Databending
Databending is an artistic practice where the artist operates on the raw data of a media file as a means of manipulating it aesthetically.

One easy way to do this is to open a media as if it were a different kind of media file and edit it using that media's tools. (eg. open a `.bmp` file in audacity and apply reverb) (see Antonio Robert's site for a great [tutorial](https://www.hellocatfood.com/databending-using-audacity/) )

Another would be to use a text editor to mess with the characters of an image file.

The results can be wild and surprisingly coherent depending on the parameters.

### field notes

-Useful audio content can be found in image files provided the audio editor assumes a very low sample rate. (eg. 8000 hz) This prevents extremely uncomfortable high frequencies from accumulating (There is very often a repeated pitch high in the spectrum.) and even creates the perception of meso structure. (eg. repeating rhythm and melody)

-When saving the image files again. Some effects can safely manipulate header data and some result in corrupt files. Most effects will produce usable files if the first few moments are kept totally dry.

-Time based effects typically produce repetition in the image as well as swirling colors.

-Distortion and compression seem to have the effect of replacing values above certain color thresholds with noise.

-purely spectral effects seem to mostly affect color
