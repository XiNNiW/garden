# Debt (the first 5,000 years)
Debt is a book by anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and is the first comprehensive history of the concept of debt ever written.

It covers the development of the idea of debt and its relationship to common understandings of morality, the state, violence, and culture. 

It begins with what Graeber calls "a moral confusion". It is common moral sense that "one ought to pay ones debts". Graeber argues that, in our culture, this is felt to be reflexively true in a way that we are not fully conscious of. As a result we apply this thinking even when it doesn't make sense. (For example, when the creditor is clearly manipulative) Popular moral philosophy centers debt as a concept. From some perspectives, all morality is seen as debt.

A history of debt is also a history of money...
Also questionable is the story that we tell ourselves about the history of money. Most economics textbooks start out with a common sense history of the evolution of money that is entirely fabricated. This history always begins with a barter economy and then introduces [[money]] as a way to ease the burden of trading with a larger number of people with a wider variety of needs. (ex. If your neighbors neighbor needs chickens but all you have is a cow, you would need to barter your way to chickens to trade with that person)

According to anthropological/archaeological evidence most human economies begin with complex credit systems. Debts between neighbors or merchants were tracked and settled against each other often in the absence of physical currency.

Graeber then covers a broad range of different economic and social arrangements between humans.
He argues that orthodox economists only consider exchange relationships between humans. He categorized human arrangements into exchange, hierarchy, and communism.
In hierarchical relationships, debt as a concept does not make sense as one party is not equal to another. A person cannot be said to have a debt to a king or a god. 1. No-one has anything the king wants as the king owns anything he wants. Its dangerous to have something that the kind doesn't have. Similarly, a god is all powerful. It can have anything is desires. A debt to a king or a god isn't really a debt, its a demand. A debt from a king to a subject isn't a debt, its a gift.
Graber defines communism as any relationship defined according to "to each according to their needs, from each according to their abilities." Graeber outlines what he calls [[everyday communism]] where ordinary people operate according to this principle. 
Exchange implies two equal parties trading to get each get something that they want for something that they have.


Graeber covers debt over the following time periods: Prehistory, The Axial Age, The Middle Ages, Colonialist Era, The Modern Era.

Graeber notes an oscillating pattern of periods of virtual currency and periods of hard bullion. The periods of bullion are always accompanied by immense violence and chattel slavery.

In the Axial Age, standardized hard currency is developed by the State as a way to feed standing armies. This leads to a complex of mining for precious metals, slavery, and warfare. This complex is at the heart of the growth of the great empires of the Axial age. Debt is used as a mechanism to entrap people in slavery.

The Middle Ages mark a return to virtual currency, the outlaw of usury, and the disappearance of chattel slavery. Credit is seen as honorable and as an extension of ones trustworthiness. Everyone is in each other's debts and debts are periodically forgiven. While this is in many ways and improvement to the Axial age, it should not be idealized. Almost no hard currency is around, however debts are sometimes measured in old Roman currency, even though no-one had any. Precious metals consolidate in the church. Gradually interest taking is made semi-legal. Merchants use debts to conscript knights into military/plunder/trade ventures.

The power of wealthy merchants and the monarchy consolidates in the Enlightenment. Loans from the King are turned into tokens of debt that can be traded. Charging interest is made legal. Laws are introduced to enforce payments of debts. Ordinary people now have the power to place each other in debtors prisons, which, for a poor person, is essentially a death sentence. Attitudes regarding debt and credit change and debt and credit are seen as dirty and immoral. By contrast hard currency is seen as moral. There is very little hard currency in circulation.
Paper debts are circulated as currency, again to fund war/exploitation/trade ventures. The first joint-stock corporations are combination military and trade ventures. Debt is used to impel people to join these ventures and used to manipulate colonized peoples. Chattel slavery is at the heart of these early capitalist ventures.
