#Digital Audio
:cc0:
Digital audio is sound in digital form (see: [digital sampling](digital filters)). It may also refer to a number of signal processing techniques for recording, transmitting, storing, generating, and modifying that digital representation either in real time or offline.

  sndkit contains Paul's implementations of a large variety of dsp algorithms. 
  Written in the [literate programming](literate programming) style, it included conceptual explanations inline with the source code.
