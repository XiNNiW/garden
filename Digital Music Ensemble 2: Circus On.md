#DME 2

This semester we are doing a version of Circus On using James Baldwin's short story *Sonny's Blues*.
The piece involves making a [mesostic](mesostic) of the text using the author's name and then collecting all the sounds and images present in those lines. These sounds and images are then performed along with the poetry.
