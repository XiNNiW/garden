# Electric Bass Technique

A few things I have learned in the first few weeks of playing the bass:
1. The touch needed to get good tone is a push not a pluck
	- the finger should push through the string coming to rest either on the pickup or on the string below. The tone should be a *thump* and the finger should rest in a way that mutes the other strings.
	- try playing with only once finger to get used to how different this is from guitar
	- try alternating your picking hand and get as even 8th notes as you can

2. On your fretting hand you use index, middle and pinky... you don't use the ring finger very often. The frets are bigger so trying to fret it like a guitar and using your 3rd finger for the 3rd fret is going to hurt your wrist. Instead use your pinky, backed up by your ring finger to fret this way. Try taping your pinky and ring finger together to get used to this.
3. Two finger technique either strictly alternates index and middle fingers or repeats use of one of these fingers in the case of a downward string change. 
4. the groove often follows the kick drum and sounds tighter if the bass is muted precisely on the snare
