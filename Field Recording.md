# Field Recording
:cc0:

Field recording is the process of making a recording outside of a specialized recording environment. (for example, in the woods) It often utilized specialized microphones and portable recorders capable of capturing sound with an incredibly low noise floor.

### notes on making recordings with my zoom h4n
1. the noise floor isn't as low as it probably needs to be... record louder things
2. use headphones to understand what the mic is hearing
3. use fabric to block the wind
4. try not to touch the recorder while its on
5. record for longer than you think you need to
6. listen very carefully while recording
7. treat the process as a kind of meditation
