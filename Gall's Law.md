# Gall's Law

"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system." - John Gall

John Gall was a systems thinker and paediatrician operating out of Ann Arbor Michigan. He wrote several influential books about systems design. He is a big influence on Rich Sheridan and James Goeble. At Menlo Innovations, we had Gall's law printed on a wall in giant font.
