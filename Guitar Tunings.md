# Guitar Tuning

alternate tunings are a great way to refresh your view of the instrument. Tunings rearrange the ease of certain chords and harmonies over others, suggesting different melodies and chord patterns. Changing tuning is a great way to start [writing a new song](Songwriting) if you are stuck.

## Standard
E - A - D - G - B - E

## Drop D

Common rock tuning. Jeff Tweedy uses it a surprising amount.

This creates really pretty wholetone and semitone relationships between strings... Picking becomes a way of making melodies.
