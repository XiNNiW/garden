# Guitar Tuning

alternate tunings are a great way to refresh your view of the instrument. Tunings rearrange the ease of certain chords and harmonies over others, suggesting different melodies or [[../Songwriting/index]].

## Standard
E - A - D - G - B - E

## Drop D
D - A - D - G - B - E
common rock tuning. Jeff Tweedy uses it a surprising amount.

## DADGAD
D - A - D - G - A - D

common blues tuning

## Open G
D - G - D - G - B - D

## Open D
D - A - D - F# - A - D

## Terminal Paradise 
D - A - D - F# - G - D
This creates really pretty wholetone and semitone relationships between strings... picking becomes a way of making melodies.

## UFOF
C - G - C - G - G - G
