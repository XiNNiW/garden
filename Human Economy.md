#Human Economy

A human economy is one where money is used primarily as a way of reorganizing social relationships and not as a means of exchanging goods and services. The term was coined by David Graeber in his book [Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value](Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value). He continued to write about the idea in [Debt:the first 5,000 years](Debt: The First 5,000 years) and his essay [All Economies Are Ultimately Human Economies](All Economies Are Ultimately Human Economies).
