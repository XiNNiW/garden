#Minimum requirements Abelton Live 1.5

### Abelton Live Version 1.5
> Spring 2002
> System Requirements:
> G3 Macintosh or faster
> 64 megabytes of RAM
> CD-ROM drive
> MacOS 8.6
> 256 color monitor, 800 x 600 pixels

I find this set of specs fascinating given what Live was able to achieve on this platform. Version 1.5 of Live has a surprising amount of workflow in common with the current version of Abelton Live (v.11 at the time of writing).
#### Features already present in v 1.5:
- mixing (panning, summing, sends)
- real-time audio stretching and sampling
- the famous session view -> arrangement view -> session view workflow
- vst audio effects

Notably missing was midi sequencing and therefor VSTi's although I don't think this omission was due to any performance restrictions.
Multitrack recording was added in version 2, and midi control in 3, virtual instruments in 4.

Looking through the version requirements of subsequent versions of Live we get through live 6 before we see a change in processor speed requirement. The most rapid bloat in requirements seems to come in the form of required ram.

How much of this increase in RAM consumption was driven by the graphical environment and how much was driven by increasing audio requirements? I suspect that the graphical environment is the main driver. One hint is that the windows specs consistently require 1/2 the amount of RAM as the Mac versions.

What features were dropped in later versions because the performance benefits they offered became obsolete with faster hardware?
