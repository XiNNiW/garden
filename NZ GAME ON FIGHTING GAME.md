# fighting game mechanics

- a character where their attack power increases as they are damaged
- but their moves slow down
- vampire character/ werewolf
- health draining attacks
- combo traditional fighter / platform fighter .. how would we change the format without changing the mechanics?
- once you get low health you get buff you can spend on unique special attack
- characters with whips
- a character who grows vines and roots to attack... they act as shields
- a grab that works at range
- dead cells war javelin (weapon you teleport to)
- puppet character
- a character where after you land a certain number of combos you transform ... attacks in stronger mode drain your HP... have to use a special to exit.. then you get some health back...
- if you get all of a certian item you transform.. insane damage but constantly losing health
-
- more interplay between main character and puppet
- puppet character has to spend a resource to set up a move with the puppet but then the puppet uses that same resource when they move as a balance
- special the main character has... when they are close enough to the puppet the move is cancelled and the main character does a special move... you can set up a combo sacrificing the main characters movement to hasten the recovery
  - explicitly summon the puppet
