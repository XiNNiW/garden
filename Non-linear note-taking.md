# Non-linear Note-taking

Non-linear note-taking is the idea of recording your thoughts in a way that allows you to navigate them in non-sequential ways. For example, a daily log written sequentially in a notebook is linear in time. A [digital garden](digital garden), personal wiki, or [zettlekeston](zettlekeston) is organized by connections between ideas. New connections can be made as the documents are written. This is an example of non-linear note-taking.
