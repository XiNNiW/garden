# Pairing

Originating as part of the *Extreme Programming* software development practice popularized by Kent Beck, pairing is where two people complete a task while sharing the tool used to complete that task. It is two minds mono-focused on a single goal, working together to reach it. In paired programming, two engineers share a keyboard and mouse, passing it back and forth as they write the software. 

There are numerous benefits of this practice that can be thought of in terms of business value. I want to focus on how pairing affects the creative process.
