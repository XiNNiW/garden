# Permacomputing
Borrowed from the term [Permaculture], permacomputing is a branch of computer science that seeks to make computational technologies that are ecologically sustainable and immune from the disruptions that are accompanying the climate crisis.
Themes include:
- highly efficient software that is capable of running on old, low-power hardware
- open source software and hardware
- resilient minimal operating systems capable of being built for scavenged, improvised computers in the event of a civilizational collapse. (see: [Collapse OS](https://collapseos.org/))
