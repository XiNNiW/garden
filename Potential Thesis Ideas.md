# Potential Thesis Ideas

## Observations
When I think about the topics that have held my interest over the last few years there are definitely themes. Maybe writing those down will help with a direction.

### themes
- sustainability/ecology/mutual survival
- synthesis/modularity/animated sound/organic aesthetic from synthetic parts
- pattern music/algorithmic expression/heritage algorithms
- community/freedom/responsibility/anarchy
- FOSS/federation
- human economies, value and values, caring labor

### what does a successful solution look like?
Ultimately the problem is bigger than music tech, tech in general, or even production and consumption. In order to survive the climate crisis we will need to upend the received moral wisdom about value, values and the meaning of work. Our economies will need to be re-organized to emphasize caring labor. Caring in that it is primarily focused on the creation of one another and the flourishing of the land.

But lets focus on music tech. Its what I am most inclined to explore as an artist and where I have the most to contribute. Besides, ["A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system." - John Gall](Gall's Law)

How does one design a simple system that works? It strikes me that *you* don't - *we* design a simple system that works.

Can we create a microcosm of this world inside of the world of synthesizers, new musical instruments, artists, and communities?

Such a microcosm would be multifaceted. It would have to care for technical, ecological, economic, and cultural factors. It would have to consider the creation of value in community.

A successful solution would look like a healthy community whose labor cares for each other and their shared ecology. This community would not be homeostatic but dynamic - creating radical new things from the old while caring not to waste or exploit either their physical world or each other.

Open Hardware/FOSS/Federation and open protocols

## Solution Bucket
### A livecoding language written against a simple virtual machine

Taking a cue from 100r and the software preservation studies they are interested in create a small virtual machine that could be implemented in 2-3 weeks by one developer and the specifications for which could be written in a few pages printed out or at least a *small* book.

Try to wring as much interesting synthesis and pattern manipulation as possible out of limited specs. Target a machine that is 10 years old.

Have slightly higher specs than UXN so that more DSP can be done. (see [specs for abelton live 2](Minimum requirements: Ableton Live 1.5.md))

### A custom livecoding language

I very much want to learn how to make my own livecoding language. Why? There are so many good ones available. Making music algorithmically always feels very personal for me. I often enjoy other languages but feel like I quickly begin customizing or pushing their boundaries. This may be a personality trait but I think it is also an indicator that there is something I want to find a more fluid expression for.
A list of things I commonly want to explore:
- feedback and non-linearity
- the (permeable) boundary between pattern, composition, and synthesis
- dance music
- "growth based" exploration vs. "production based" exploration
- algorithmic pattern

Many languages afford one or more of these areas to be freely explored but I have not found any fully satisfying.

### an alternative interface for a livecoding language

Most all livecoding languages utilize text input with a text-editor being the primary interface. This is elegant as typing is arguably what laptop computers are best at. However, there are so many other ways to express algorithmic thought.

- gesture based livecoding with a pen
- gesture based livecoding with a motion sensor
- speech based livecoding
- grid-based livecoding with a monome grid or something like it
- rhythmic based livecoding with patterns as commands

### synthetic gamelon
I love that the gamelon is not an instrument but an ensemble to which instruments belong. The reyong player does not walk to the next town and take their instrument to play with another band. Rather, the reyong is tuned so that it matches with the ensemble and the ensemble belongs to the village center. What would this look like with electronic instruments? Would there be a way to support this kind of community musicing with synthesizers. This question makes me think of Peter Blasser's wild and wonderful instruments. Specifically the tocante are tuned based on standard component ranges of resistors and capacitors, with each tocante tuned differently. What if one used a similar idea of hyper local tuning scheme to create a group of synthetic instruments that each had a separate role in the music. Perhaps these instruments could be modeled off of existing gamelon and gamelon composers could be commissioned to write pieces for the new instruments (collab with Gavin).

The community aspect of this kind of setup appeals to me for multiple reasons
