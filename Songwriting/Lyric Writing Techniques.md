# Lyric Writing Techniques
Below are various exercises for writing lyrics that I have found useful as a starting place when I'm stuck.

## Hot pen
Set a timer. Write until the timer runs out. Do not let yourself stop until the timer is done. Write nonsense if you have to.

## Begin each line with the last word from the previous
This works well in conjunction with hot pen. Try to make a line that starts with the last word of the prior line. This create an artificial sense of continuity and may reveal relationships between ideas that you have not previously considered.

## Cutup technique
