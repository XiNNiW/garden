# Pop song form
To me stereotypical pop song form is as follows. Verse - [Prechorus] - Chorus - Verse - [Prechorus] - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus. The first verse is sometimes twice as long as the second. It may also include an intro and/or outro section. It may or may not include a prechorus. The form is a little bit like a roller-coaster, with energy cresting at each chorus.

*I Want to Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)* by Whitney Houston, aside from being a banger, has the most prototypical pop form I can think of.

Newer pop songs frequently break out of this structure. (eg. *Sicko Mode* "Travis Scott")
