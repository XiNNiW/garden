# Through Composed Form
When a piece of music is through composed  its form does not contain repetitions. In pop and folk songs this allows for internal repetition of musical ideas but not for repetition of whole sections. An example of a through composed form would be the following: 
`A-B-C-D` 

Some songs with through composed forms:
*Bohemian Rhapsody* by Queen
*In Dreams* by Roy Orbison
*Sicko Mode* by Travis Scott
*Paranoid Android* by Radiohead

Through composed form can give a track a dreamlike sense of wandering. Each section is like a scene or a room, different from the last one, but similar enough to be familiar.

My favorite through composed songs make heavy use of internal repetition for at least some sections. If both the form and the musical ideas float, its too much floating for my taste.
