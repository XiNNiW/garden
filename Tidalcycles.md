# Tidalcycles 

[Tidalcycles](http://tidalcycles.org/) is a music livecoding environment created by Alex Maclean. Tidalcycles is concerned with the creation and manipulation of musical pattern. Tidal defines a pattern as a function mapping time to events. The tidal library consists of functions that can be composed together in various ways to change the way that events are mapped to time. Tidal contains a "mini-notation" that allows to musician to create cyclical rhythmic patterns. The concept for mini-notation grew out of a part of the [bol processor](https://bolprocessor.org/) that was meant to notate tabla rhythms from Indian Classical music. By default, it encourages the user to subdivide time in ways that are more commonly found in Indian Classical music.
