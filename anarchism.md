# anarchism

It would seem antithetical to provide a single authoritative definition for something like anarchism. Here is a list of different definitions I've seen:

### Kant

According to Kant, Anarchy is a form of social organization that allows for individual freedom, has a democratic rule of law, and that is not predicated on violence.
