# anarchism

It would seem antithetical to provide a single authoritative definition for something like anarchism. Here is a list of different definitions I've seen:

### Graeber
[David Graeber](David Graeber) described himself as an anarchist with a "small a". I interpret that as meaning being inclusive to all those who wanted to operate without coercion. To me its the idea that there isn't one right way to do it.

### LeGuin
[Ursela K. LeGuin](Ursela K. LeGuin) wrote in her book [The Day Before the Revolution](The Day Before the Revolution): “What is an anarchist? One who, choosing, accepts the responsibility of choice.”

### Chomsky
In a talk Chomsky gave in the 1980's he defined anarchists as people who believe that coercive authority must be justified. He gives an example of pulling his daughter out of the way of a speeding car. This is a coercive intervention but hardly anyone would argue that it was unjustified....

### Kant
According to Kant, Anarchy is a form of social organization that allows for individual freedom, has a democratic rule of law, and that is not predicated on violence. Kant dismissed this mode of social organization as impossible. This is still the most common reaction to anarchism from those who share this definition of it.
anarchism is the belief that such societies are possible and desirable.
Its maybe best to take this guys opinion with a grain of salt. He never left his home town and was super racist.
