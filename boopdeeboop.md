A paradise
(A season)
I’m paralyzed
(It’s stealing)

I’m alive
(A season)
An arrow flies
(seizes me)

Then it comes, my morning bell
klaxon of the ending

What you see, what you are 
What you know how to see
(Its clear now)

Paralyzed
(A season)
Paradise
(Unwilling)

Paralyzed
(A season)
Paradise
(Unwilling)

You can swim, you can fly, you can do anything you like

In my dreams
every day
can't stay awake
I'm breathing hard
just to stay 
in the same place

In my dreams
my mistake
can't stay awake
I fall asleep
and the years
just fly away

It sleeps with me now
(Nothing felt very hard)
Sleeping with the lights on
(My warmest light)

It sleeps with me now
(Nothing felt very hard)
Sleeping with the lights on
(My warmest light)

Am I ever coming down?
Am I ever coming, ever coming down?


### scraps

in my dreams
queen of hearts
it a weekday
i fall asleep
and the years
all fly away

then im asleep
in my dreams 
im following
sign of life
advertise 
my qualities

click-bait sleep
in the car
on Saturday
i fall asleep
and the years
all fly away
Years all fly away till I lose my feathers
I’ll say what I wanna say etc. etc….
