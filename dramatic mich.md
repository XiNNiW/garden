Sing a lonely song oh no
lonely song oh no
I don't belong here
I sing a stony
Sing a phony song oh no
phony song oh no
masks all the way down

I'm singing
Only her oh sow me snow me slow
(And nobody's watching you now)
Oh see her see me seem alright
(And nobody's watching you now)
can't see what you don't know how

Only him oh sow me snow me slow
(And nobody's watching you now)
Oh see them see me seem alright
(it slows me down)
can't see what you don't know how

You can change your mind
you shape it all the time
you see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

Alleluia-on and on and on

Da da da da da da da

(years passed on the surface)
(I heard you moving in the shallows)
(I heard you laughing in my own voice)
(I felt you looking at me from under the water)
()

You can change your mind
you shape it all the time
you see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

You can change your mind
you shape it all the time
you see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

Sing a lonely song oh no

It’s a weakness we all know
lonely song oh no
oh what goes on now
I sink down below, down below

Think another thought i know
lonely song oh no
oh no goes on now
oh what goes on now
I sink down below

Only her oh sow me snow me slow
Oh see now see now see now, you
see what you know how to

You’re doing whatever you can
And everyone’s watching you fall

It’s a weakness we all know

You can unmake your mind
you shape it all the time
see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

Alleluia-on and on and on

Da da da da da da da

(I heard we like the same things…)

You can unmake your mind
you shape it all the time
see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

You can unmake your mind
you shape it all the time
see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through


// ================================================================== //

you can unmake your mind
you shape it all the time
see yourself, you see yourself
your mostly see through

he the lonely one

(your doing whatever you can)
(everyone's watching you fall)

its a weakness we all know


its in your heart

hallaeluah, on an on 

don't set your sights so low
when its all too much to hold
we see their eyes, see their eyes to hold
hold as we explode

the moment we --
the moment we explode
close your eyes, close your eyes 
to slow the --

i get unboxed now
misshapen eyebrows
its masks all the way down
we shape what world we hold
we make the world our own
we see ourselves, see ourselves 
we're mostly see-through

don't set your sight so low
you shape all you hold
we shape our live, shape our live
----

its in their eyes they know
its gleaming like the snow

i saw it rise to low
its in their right to know

It’s in their right to know
It’s seeping from your heart
Asleep or wake beneath you shaking
Always see through oh
Lonelier oh sow me oh me oh
Oh see now see now see now, right
I’ll leave this thing alone, oh
Sting a boney swan oh no
study the invention
(and in the shallows)
(and that's why I'll never leave you)
clean wonder
years passed in the surface
men laughed in her voice
sky turned gold
(and in the shadows)
(I heard you like my favourite licitra)
(I heard we like the same things)
(and that's why you'll always make me drip from the waist down)
(and that's why I'll never forget you)
