This is the image I hang on my door
A wide green lawn turning brown in the heat
The part of me that I keep in the drawer 
that wakens and __ in the dead of my sleep

A motel room with a view of the car
the smell of all the wrong intentions 

I know the city’s all in my mind
No windows no doors, no sense of place
On the way to the casino food court


If I gave him what he wanted

The silent auction is ready to bid
Driving the price to impress your family
‘Cause nothing’s too much for my little girl

They fill the hall with the sound of applause
We need a hero to take up the cause

I’m toppled by neolithic desires
I buried my talent deep in the earth
The city’s fingers pressed into the sky

Colorful paper that’s hiding a name

They like to sneak in their thank you notes

If I could only get out of the way
The simmering sense that nothing has changed
Now something you can’t pretend to ignore
The sinking feeling that something’s not right

Even if the bombs never come

Is this what I really wanted
Always said this is what I really wanted
I thought this is what I wanted
If I said this is what I wanted
Everything I've done to never be forgotten
You should have known better than to be a mountain

(I've got a word inside my mouth)
(I want to put it somewhere else)



I’m getting dressed for the charity ball

what's in the weeds say my love ritual 
what's is a life save all we consume
i don't see why your so over the moon
whats is the lits of your love old narwhal

its a
fight for another chorus
you thought you were done but there's another chorus
fight for another chorus
you thought you were done but there's one more chorus
(i walk with pride inside myself)
(what I've got you cant replace yourself)
(I've got a thing inside my mouth)
(i want to put it somewhere else)
(just like I could never have myself)
(just like you could never have yourself)

(i felt it coming like water and wine)
you say you senses are left on the shelf
(its good enough for me now)






### scrap

~~whats seems alive(real life) sings so all is se soom~~
the flickering of some dark ritual
ritual collapse my love is a wall
what in the sun is a wall you say so
a tender night for a dark ritual
i don't see why your so over the moon

a prize that nobody wanted
the empty promise of the work you never needed 
its a prize that nobody wanted
you thought it was done but surprise there's another --

i felt it coming like water and wine
you say you senses are left on the shelf
its good enough for me now

a prize that nobody wanted
congratulations its a prize that nobody wanted
its a prize that nobody wanted
you thought we were done but there's one more coin release

you thought we were done but there is another drawing

i walk with pride inside myself
i live my life like no-one else
I'll set the world against itself
the faith ill never lose myself
what i have you cant replace yourself
I've got a thing inside my mouth
i want to put it somewhere else

ill never feel with someone else
