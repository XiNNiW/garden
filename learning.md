# Learning

Notes on the process of learning, how to learn, things learned about learning.

#### Its easier with someone else
I learn best when in conversation with someone else. Pairing is brilliant for this. You both work together to learn enough to solve your current problem. You teach each other, gaining both the benefits of learning and teaching.

#### Teach
If you can't explain it to someone else in a way that is simple and understandable you don't really know it. To teach someone you have to understand how they are seeing and create a path from where they are to the idea. If you can't connect the idea to something that they already know, you don't know where the idea is.

#### Write
Writing your thoughts down forces them to solidify. Making your writing better improves the clarity of your ideas. Our memories are also quite short. Writing your thoughts down lets you work around the shortness of memory and remember ideas long enough to make connections between them.

#### Non-linear note-taking
Finding connections between ideas is a fundamental part of what it means to learn something. [[Non-linear note-taking]] is a way to allow those connections to grow over time and to traverse your writing by those connections as opposed to a more arbitrary index (such as date written).
