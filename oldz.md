climb
on the road you'll never make it alone
falling
It’s in the well it’s in the weeds it’s all you needed

Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong)
can you carry the sun?
can you carry (inside a song)
our home? 

Yesterday they flipped their shit and blew up pipelines

Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong)
will you carry the sun?
will you carry (inside a sun)
our home?

Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong)
will you carry my song?
will you carry (inside a song)
us home
  
You've got the names of everyone I know 
You come to mind
I'm never letting go
Let out your sigh
I've got a car to ride
All jokes aside
We’re never going home

Carry (you got it wrong, you got it wrong)   
I want to carry the sun (inside a song)                 
I want to carry our home

Carry (you got it wrong, you got it wrong)   
I want to carry the sun (inside a song)                 
I want to carry our home
(Beat faster)

### scraps

There are these days where I forget to see the sun
we're shaping trees, we're shaping weeds to what we need
